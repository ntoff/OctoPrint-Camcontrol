# OctoPrint-Camcontrol

Adds a little button up in octoprint's nav bar as a shortcut to mjpeg streamer's "control" page where you can change brightness, contrast, etc.

I made this plugin for myself and no one else, the only reason it's here on github is A) to make it easier to install on both my printers and B) because I like to open source most of the stuff I make. My particular web cam sucks and the control page in mjpeg streamer is the only way to adjust brightness/ contrast/etc (octopi.txt doesn't work for me), and as such it is designed to work for me, my hardware, and my particular **manual** installation of octoprint + mjpeg streamer.

This plugin does *not* offer zoom, pan, tilt, or any extra functionality, it is merely a shortcut to a web page, and whether or not that web page even exists will depend on how octoprint / mjpeg streamer were installed.
